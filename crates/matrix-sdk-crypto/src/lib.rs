/// # Introduction
///
/// Welcome to the first part of this guide, where we will introduce the
/// fundamental concepts of end-to-end encryption and its implementation in
/// Matrix.
///
/// This section will provide a clear and concise overview of what
/// end-to-end encryption is and why it is important for secure communication.
/// You will also learn about how Matrix uses end-to-end encryption to protect
/// the privacy and security of its users' communications. Whether you are new
/// to the topic or simply want to improve your understanding, this section will
/// serve as a solid foundation for the rest of the guide.
///
/// Let's dive in!
///
/// ## Notation
///
/// ## End-to-end-encryption
///
/// End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a method of secure communication where only
/// the communicating devices, also known as "the ends," can read the data being
/// transmitted. This means that the data is encrypted on one device, and can
/// only be decrypted on the other device. The server is used only as a
/// transport mechanism to deliver messages between devices.
///
/// The following chart displays how communication between two clients using a
/// server in the middle usually works.
///
/// ```mermaid
/// flowchart LR
///     alice[Alice]
///     bob[Bob]
///     subgraph Homeserver
///         direction LR
///         outbox[Alice outbox]
///         inbox[Bob inbox]
///         outbox -. unencrypted .-> inbox
///     end
///
///     alice -- encrypted --> outbox
///     inbox -- encrypted --> bob
/// ```
///
/// The next chart, instead, displays how the same flow is happening in a
/// end-to-end-encrypted world.
///
/// ```mermaid
/// flowchart LR
///     alice[Alice]
///     bob[Bob]
///     subgraph Homeserver
///         direction LR
///         outbox[Alice outbox]
///         inbox[Bob inbox]
///         outbox == encrypted ==> inbox
///     end
///
///     alice == encrypted ==> outbox
///     inbox == encrypted ==> bob
/// ```
///
/// Note that the path from the outbox to the inbox is now encrypted as well.
///
/// Alice and Bob have created a secure communication channel
/// through which they can exchange messages confidentially, without the risk of
/// the server accessing the contents of their messages.
///
/// ## Publishing cryptographic identities of devices
///
/// If Alice and Bob want to establish a secure channel over which they can
/// exchange messages, they first need learn about each others cryptographic
/// identities. This is achieved by using the homeserver as a public key
/// directory.
///
/// A public key directory is used to store and distribute public keys of users
/// in an end-to-end encrypted system. The basic idea behind a public key
/// directory is that it allows users to easily discover and download the public
/// keys of other users with whom they wish to establish an end-to-end encrypted
/// communication.
///
/// Each user generates a pair of public and private keys. The user then uploads
/// their public key to the public key directory. Other users can then search
/// the directory to find the public key of the user they wish to communicate
/// with, and download it to their own device.
///
/// ```mermaid
/// flowchart LR
///     alice[Alice]
///     subgraph homeserver[Homeserver]
///         direction LR
///         directory[(Public key directory)]
///     end
///     bob[Bob]
///
///     alice -- upload keys --> directory
///     directory -- download keys --> bob
/// ```
///
/// Once a user has the other user's public key, they can use it to establish an
/// end-to-end encrypted channel using a [key-agreement] protocol.
///
/// ## Using the Triple Diffie-Hellman key-agreement protocol
///
/// In X3DH, each user generates a long-term identity key pair and a set of
/// one-time prekeys. When two users want to establish a shared secret key, they
/// exchange their public identity keys and one of their prekeys. These public
/// keys are then used in a [Diffie-Hellman] key exchange to compute a shared
/// secret key.
///
/// The use of one-time prekeys ensures that the shared secret key is different
/// for each session, even if the same identity keys are used.
///
/// ```mermaid
/// flowchart LR
/// subgraph alice_keys[Alice Keys]
///     direction TB
///     alice_key[Alice's identity key]
///     alice_base_key[Alice's one-time key]
/// end
///
/// subgraph bob_keys[Bob Keys]
///     direction TB
///     bob_key[Bob's identity key]
///     bob_one_time[Bob's one-time key]
/// end
///
/// alice_key <--> bob_one_time
/// alice_base_key <--> bob_one_time
/// alice_base_key <--> bob_key
/// ```
///
/// Similar to [X3DH] (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman) key agreement protocol
///
/// ## Speeding up encryption for large groups
///
/// TODO Explain how megolm fits into this
///
/// # Getting started
///
/// In the [Matrix] world the server is called a [homeserver]
///
/// ## Push/pull mechanism
///
/// ```mermaid
/// flowchart LR
///     homeserver[Homeserver]
///     client[OlmMachine]
///
///     homeserver -- pull --> client
///     client -- push --> homeserver
/// ```
///
/// ## Initializing the state machine
///
/// ```
/// use anyhow::Result;
/// use matrix_sdk_crypto::OlmMachine;
/// use ruma::user_id;
///
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// let user_id = user_id!("@alice:localhost");
/// let device_id = "DEVICEID".into();
///
/// let machine = OlmMachine::new(user_id, device_id).await;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// This will create a [`OlmMachine`] that does not persist any data TODO
/// ```ignore
/// use anyhow::Result;
/// use matrix_sdk_crypto::OlmMachine;
/// use matrix_sdk_sled::SledCryptoStore;
/// use ruma::user_id;
///
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// let user_id = user_id!("@alice:localhost");
/// let device_id = "DEVICEID".into();
///
/// let store = SledCryptoStore::open("/home/example/matrix-client/").await?;
///
/// let machine = OlmMachine::with_store(user_id, device_id, store).await;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Decryption
///
/// In the world of encrypted communication, it is common to start with the
/// encryption step when implementing a protocol. However, in the case of adding
/// end-to-end encryption support to a Matrix client library, a simpler approach
/// is to first focus on the decryption process. This is because there are
/// already Matrix clients in existence that support encryption, which means
/// that our client library can simply receive encrypted messages and then
/// decrypt them.
///
/// In this section, we will guide you through the minimal steps
/// necessary to get the decryption process up and running using the
/// matrix-sdk-crypto Rust crate. By the end of this section you should have a
/// Matrix client that is able to decrypt room events that other clients have
/// sent.
///
/// To enable decryption the following three steps are needed:
///
/// 1. [The cryptographic identity of your device needs to be published to the
/// homeserver](#uploading-identity-and-one-time-keys).
/// 2. [Decryption keys coming in from other devices need to be processed and
/// stored](#receiving-room-keys-and-related-changes).
/// 3. [Individual messages need to be decrypted](#decrypting-room-events).
///
/// The simplified flowchart
/// ```mermaid
/// graph TD
///     sync[Sync with the homeserver]
///     receive_changes[Push E2EE related changes into the state machine]
///     send_outgoing_requests[Send all outgoing requests to the homeserver]
///     decrypt[Process the rest of the sync]
///
///     sync --> receive_changes;
///     receive_changes --> send_outgoing_requests;
///     send_outgoing_requests --> decrypt;
///     decrypt -- repeat --> sync;
/// ```
///
/// ## Uploading identity and one-time keys.
///
/// The first step is to announce the support for it to other users in the
/// Matrix network. This involves publishing your long-term device keys and a
/// set of one-time prekeys to the homeserver. This information is used by other
/// devices to encrypt messages specifically for your device.
///
/// To achieve this, you will need to extract any requests that need to be sent
/// to the homeserver from the [`OlmMachine`] and send them to the homeserver.
/// The following snipped showcases how to achieve this using the
/// [`OlmMachine::outgoing_requests()`] method:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use std::collections::BTreeMap;
/// # use ruma::api::client::keys::upload_keys::v3::Response;
/// # use anyhow::Result;
/// # use matrix_sdk_crypto::{OlmMachine, OutgoingRequest};
/// # async fn send_request(request: OutgoingRequest) -> Result<Response> {
/// #     let response = unimplemented!();
/// #     Ok(response)
/// # }
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// # let machine: OlmMachine = unimplemented!();
/// // Get all the outgoing requests.
/// let outgoing_requests = machine.outgoing_requests().await?;
///
/// // Send each request to the server and push the response into the state machine.
/// for request in outgoing_requests {
///     // You can safely send out these requests out in parallel.
///     let request_id = request.request_id();
///     let response = send_request(request).await?;
///     machine.mark_request_as_sent(&request_id, &response).await?;
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Receiving room keys and related changes
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use std::collections::BTreeMap;
/// # use anyhow::Result;
/// # use matrix_sdk_crypto::OlmMachine;
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// # let to_device_events = Vec::new();
/// # let changed_devices = Default::default();
/// # let one_time_key_counts = BTreeMap::default();
/// # let unused_fallback_keys = Some(Vec::new());
/// # let machine: OlmMachine = unimplemented!();
/// // Push changes that the server sent to us in a sync response.
/// let decrypted_to_device = machine
///     .receive_sync_changes(
///         to_device_events,
///         &changed_devices,
///         &one_time_key_counts,
///         unused_fallback_keys.as_deref(),
///     )
///     .await?;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Decrypting room events
///
/// The final step in the decryption process is to decrypt the room events that
/// are received from the server. To do this, the encrypted events must be
/// passed to the [`OlmMachine`], which will use the keys that were previously
/// exchanged between devices to decrypt the events. The decrypted events can
/// then be processed and displayed to the user in the Matrix client.
///
/// Room events can be decrypted using the [`OlmMachine::decrypt_room_event()`]
/// method.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use std::collections::BTreeMap;
/// # use anyhow::Result;
/// # use matrix_sdk_crypto::OlmMachine;
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// # let encrypted = unimplemented!();
/// # let room_id = unimplemented!();
/// # let machine: OlmMachine = unimplemented!();
/// // Decrypt your room events now.
/// let decrypted = machine.decrypt_room_event(encrypted, room_id).await?;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
